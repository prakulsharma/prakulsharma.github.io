                        It has been some time since my last blog because I had been busy with a lot of things, both professionally and personally. I'll take this blog post, to explain how I've grown both mentally and emotionally because I believe that to be good at what I do, I need to learn to be persistent and even though I am writing this after almost a month, I assure you that I've learnt a lot over this period. I came over my fear of asking stupid doubts from my mentor. This was a hiderance for me for a long time now but I finally am working to get better at it. It took a great deal of efforts from my part and my friend's but I learnt a lot. I also learnt to practice perseverence. Sitting down for almost 8 hours daily in front of the screen and trying to absorb every word I come across had been my biggest challenge so far and I'm glad I was able to do it for the past 2 weeks now. I think I've found one of my ikigai(s). I really am liking this job even though its challenging. It does require a lot of efforts for instance even right now at 2AM I am sitting in front of my macbook downloading a batch of XML files from Azure just so I can run the Torque feature extractor I've written so beautifully and share the results with my colleague so he and I can sit together and analyze the future of this module. Now, sticking to the millieu of this website, I've started reading and have so far completed the first part of the book 'The complete idiot's guide to statistics' and I'm loving it. I'm doing so just to get a revision on these fundamental topics which got erroded from my memory. I am putting the coding part on a hold so I can finish off my work quickly. Once that is done I'll be back at it, starting from codechef and leetcode to Kaggle competitions (I and my friend tried one actually and we barely did anything and still got a rank of 161 out of over 400 teams!!). Emotinally, I've grown as well. Before this gets totally out of context I'll just mention that this month was for more than just coding. I revived my passion for cooking, painting and singing (back at FrontRow hehe) and I feel really grateful for all the things I have and those that were a part of me throughtout this journey, and I look forward to continue to do so.

                        Today, I spent my time revising my statistics knowledge by following <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/fundamentals-of-statistics-for-data-scientists-and-data-analysts-69d93a05aae7">Tatev Karen</a>. The article has really helped me get back to my weaker skills and improve them. I still have a few topics to complete which I will hopefully do tomorrow. I also updated my github profile markdown page to make it look more appealing. If you want to get that for your github as well, you can check out my code and well, I feel like it's pretty neat, aesthetic, and concise. If you do end up liking it, do let me know or maybe star it! Once I complete this article, I'll share my notes and code library to enable you to do it for yourself. Thanks for reading!

                        Today was another all-day-study day and I spent most of my time just reading blogs on machine learning. Most of it was about ARIMA but I tried to kill the monotonocity by reading about how to make a chatbox as a couple of my project ideas require me to study about NLP, in detail if possible. I came across a bunch of notebooks on kaggle that really simplify the process of how to start working on an NLP problem. They involve a lot of processes on text cleaning or preprocessing, text tokenization, bag of words etc. I really liked it and even ran it on my own locally. I will try to make a generic library that will do all the preprocessing so that the user just has to input the data into a model. If I do, I'll share the github link here.

                    Today I spent most of my time studying about ARIMA and its variants. Followed a few blogs like machine learning+ which really elucidates everything one needs to know about ARIMA and its functions. I'll share those blogs on my blog page just in case.

                        Today, I am on fire. I have made quite a good progress working on Medsol and ARIMA Library. Medsol is a project that I and my friend started working on, in July. The inspiration was the realisation of the gross condition of the healthcare system in some parts of India. In the current pandemic situation, there has been a rise in the number of people who are self-treating themselves with prescriptions, both OTC and UTC, without any professional consultations. There has also been a rise in the steroid intake among people, following the word-of-mouth of how effective they are against the COVID-19 strains. Little do they know that there is a reason we have doctors. A lot of people still don't know the implications of consuming medicines that were not prescribed to them directly. Listening to and following what their friends or relatives are consuming, is one of the things one should never do. Every medical prescription is based on a number of factors like gender, age and weight. Ignoring even one of them could lead to disastrous results. A surge in the number of people suffering and succumbing to Black Fungus is an evidence of what I am talking about. An illness, otherwise harmless, proved to be deadly in cases where people were either given wrong prescriptions or they took the liberty of doing that themselves, as their immunity was affected due to some harmful drug interaction or wrong dosage. So, what does Medsol do? It identifies the drugs (or salts) present in a medicine that was prescribed to you and searches for any interactions between them. It labels those interactions, if present, based on their severity levels and thereby warning patients to re-check their prescriptions. We have so far managed to deploy it for production but it still needs a lot of features. I don't want to talk about its prospects because the list will be endless (I'll anyway mention them on the Medsol page).&nbsp;<br>Apart from that I have started studying about time-series forecasting using ARIMA models. I was able to devote some time today to develop a vanilla model that predicts values in a dataset, which honestly was super duper fun! I wish to work on it more and turn it into a generic library that uses all the ARIMA models and its variants like ARIMAX and SARIMA.&nbsp;<br>That was all for today though, thanks for reading till the end! :)
